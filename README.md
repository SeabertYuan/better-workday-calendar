# Better Workday Calendar

A lightweight, fast, and private browser extension that fixes and improves various features on the course calendar view on UBC workday. We hope people submit issues and feedback to keep this project alive as long as possible!

This extension tags courses by their start and end dates to determine which term they should belong to. It adds buttons to allow the user to quickly display courses in their desired terms.

It fixes text cutoff issues by expanding the calendar popup area and decreasing font size slightly.

In version 2.0.0, we added the ability to export your courses into an ics file allowing you to import your course schedule into your favourite calendar app.

## Usage

This extension is available on [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/better-workday-calendar/ebgddfhinidlemocaclojkiadpknpoia) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/better-workday-calendar/) in their respective add-on stores. After installation, the extension will display additional buttons whenever the user presses the "Calendar View" button on the "view my courses" page. When the calendar view popup appears users will be able to filter their courses by terms and export their calendar!
